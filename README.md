## What is ClipCraft?

ClipCraft is a **web-first** screen recording and sharing platform for creators, teams, and educators. One recording becomes:

- **Video** — MP4 and shareable link
- **Chapters** — Clickable table of contents
- **Transcript & captions** — Searchable, exportable
- **AI summary** — Steps, key points, and descriptions
- **Course-ready exports** — Notes, outlines, quiz suggestions

No desktop app. Record in the browser, share in seconds, and let ClipCraft handle the rest.
